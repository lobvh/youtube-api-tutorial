# YouTube API / Data Pipeline ('From collection to Panda's DataFrame')

In this tutorial I will explain how you could use YouTube API to collect and mundge the data from your YouTube videos, and put it into the Pandas dataframe.

I've created a data pipeline that fetches data such as view count, like count (the data that is updated in real time!), video title, date uploaded etc., but this framework could be easily extended to your needs! The main idea is to see how easy is to use modern APIs to fetch the data needed for your project.
